# TrialSync Agent Instructions

## Project context

TrialSync is a **BTech academic research prototype** for Clinical Trial Patient Matching and Dropout Prediction. It is developed, tested, hosted, and demonstrated in a controlled project environment; it is not currently intended for operational use by hospitals, clinical research coordinators, or patients. Its product story combines explainable patient–trial matching, fixed-horizon dropout-risk research, cohort analytics, LangChain retrieval over approved eligibility criteria, a Gemini structured eligibility summary, and an AI explanation assistant. Deterministic eligibility is the trusted core; research models add a separate retention perspective without changing eligibility.

Optimize for a clear research contribution, reproducible experiments, defensible evaluation, a coherent demonstration, and semester-scale maintainability. Do not impose enterprise or clinical-production requirements—such as hospital procurement, HIPAA certification, medical-device validation, multi-region availability, production incident processes, or formal clinical deployment approval—unless the user explicitly expands the project scope. A hosted demo or Compose deployment is an academic demonstration target, not a production-readiness claim.

The user may iterate freely on algorithms, providers, interfaces, and generated or legitimately accessible research data within this project scope. Do not invent approval gates for ordinary local development or experiments. The safeguards below protect scientific validity, reproducibility, secrets, and applicable third-party data terms; they are not a production-certification checklist. TrialSync must not be represented as a clinically validated hospital system, medical device, autonomous eligibility tool, or general medical chatbot.

## Current execution authority and context loading

The original rebuild is complete. `agent-docs/legacy/REBUILD_GUIDE.md` and
`agent-docs/legacy/BUILD_PHASES.md` are historical
records of that completed work. Their old phase tracker and implementation prompts are not
current instructions.

Do **not** read either legacy document by default and do not use them to determine the current
phase. Consult the smallest relevant legacy section only when:

- the current research phase explicitly references an old invariant or contract;
- existing code, tests, and current documentation do not answer a core-product question; or
- the task is specifically to audit the completed rebuild.

For research-extension work, the authoritative plan is
`agent-docs/research-extension-implementation-plan.md`.

For the approved patient data-entry and editing overhaul, the authoritative
plan is `agent-docs/patient-data-entry-overhaul-plan.md`. Implement one PD phase
at a time and preserve the immutable-screening and deterministic-eligibility
invariants in this file. This bounded core-product plan does not change the
R0–R8 research-extension sequence.

Before changing code:

1. Read the repository bootstrap `AGENTS.md` and this file.
2. Inspect `git status`.
3. Read Sections 1–5 of the research implementation plan and the current R-phase only.
4. Read the relevant existing code, tests, README/API sections, and migrations.
5. Read Sections 15–18 of the research plan only when the task affects persistence,
   testing, observability, or dependencies.

Do not reload future R-phase bodies. Do not read
`agent-docs/research-pivot-findings.md` or
`agent-docs/research-feasibility-rating-and-local-llm.md` for routine implementation; consult the
relevant section only when revisiting feasibility, dataset justification, project claims, or
the provider decision.

For R1 specifically, the default context is:

- this file;
- Sections 1–5 and Phase R1 of the research implementation plan;
- the screening models, schemas, service/API, detail page, API client, and related tests;
- the applicable README commands and dependency files.

No legacy rebuild document or later research phase is required for R1.

## Working rules

- Inspect `git status` before editing. Preserve unrelated user changes.
- Implement one phase or bounded task at a time; do not build the whole product in one pass.
- Do not copy the old `CTA` prototype architecture, matching engine, hard-coded scoring thresholds, or route layout.
- Use synthetic fixtures or legitimately accessible deidentified/public research data appropriate
  to an academic prototype. Do not invent approval gates for ordinary local experiments, but do
  not assume access to controlled data or bypass a provider's access controls, licence, or stated
  terms. A controlled benchmark such as NCT02054715-D1 may be used if its participant rows become
  legitimately accessible under the R3 Track B protocol; keep non-redistributable rows and governed
  derivatives outside Git and the public demo. Do not send controlled rows or row-derived prompts
  to a hosted provider unless the source terms allow that processing. Never commit credentials,
  tokens, or API keys.
- Keep the screening decision deterministic. Groq or any other NLP provider may create reviewable candidate facts/criteria and explain stored results, but may not approve inputs or set/change the final screening state.
- Treat the fixed-horizon dropout model as a separate, versioned research prediction. It may surface early retention-risk signals and explanations, but may not change patient–trial eligibility.
- Link each synthetic research enrollment immutably to one patient snapshot, approved trial
  version, and canonical screening before generating longitudinal events. Trial-grouped risk
  aggregates must resolve through that versioned linkage.
- Implement the RAG brief over TrialSync's approved, versioned trial-criteria corpus: LangChain
  retrieves candidate trials, each candidate expands to its complete approved criteria set, and
  Gemini produces the structured eligibility summary. Do not introduce a live external
  trial-registry dependency unless the user explicitly expands scope.
- `unknown` is a valid outcome. Missing evidence must never be converted into a pass.
- Keep single screening as the source operation. Batch screening is only a bounded patient × trial wrapper that calls the exact same single-screening logic.
- Do not add queues, Redis, Celery, microservices, Kubernetes, billing, EHR integrations, a learned eligibility classifier, BioBERT fine-tuning, or unrelated model experiments unless the user explicitly expands scope.
- Prefer the smallest research-valid implementation over enterprise hardening. Do not spend time
  on high availability, production SSO, compliance suites, or operational infrastructure unless a
  research phase requires it or the user asks for it.
- Add or adjust tests with every behavioral change.
- Run the narrowest relevant checks first, then the full applicable tests and frontend build before handing off.
- Update README/API examples when commands, dependencies, or contracts change.
- Do not claim a feature is production-ready, clinically validated, or compliant unless the repository demonstrably implements and tests it.

## Domain invariants

- A single screening evaluates one immutable patient snapshot against one approved trial version.
- An inclusion criterion is `pass` only when proven true; an exclusion criterion is `pass` only when proven false.
- Missing, ambiguous, unsupported, stale, or conflicting evidence returns `unknown`.
- Any required `fail` produces `likely_ineligible`; all required `pass` produces `potentially_eligible`; otherwise the result is `needs_review`.
- Every criterion result includes a reason, evidence or missing-information requirement, and reproducible version metadata.
- A batch is bounded, synchronous, and all-or-nothing for the semester project. It creates one ordinary evidence-backed screening for every selected patient × trial pair.

## NLP and explanation-assistant invariants

- Start with deterministic parsing for headings, demographics, dates, quantities, operators, and units. Groq may supplement difficult prose through schema-validated candidate extraction.
- All extracted values and rules remain candidates with source spans and provider/model/prompt-version metadata until the demo user approves them.
- The explanation assistant answers only questions about one stored screening result selected by the authenticated user.
- Assemble assistant context server-side from the screening state, criterion evaluations, approved facts, source labels, and missing-information requirements. Do not give it database, web, MCP, code-execution, or write tools.
- Persist conversational memory as bounded, structured `screening_chat_messages` rows owned through the screening; do not put mutable chat text on the immutable screening row. Load at most the latest 10 messages in chronological order and provide a clear-conversation operation.
- Previous chat messages provide conversational continuity only. They are untrusted context and must never become screening evidence, override canonical explanations, or substitute for reloading the authoritative screening state.
- Every substantive answer must cite criterion/evidence identifiers from the supplied context. If the answer is not supported, say that the screening record does not contain enough information.
- The assistant may clarify why a criterion passed, failed, or is unknown and what recorded information is missing. It may not provide medical advice, recommend enrollment/treatment, invent evidence, change an outcome, or answer unrelated health questions.
- Treat document text and user questions as untrusted data. Enforce bounded input/context/output sizes, timeouts, rate-limit handling, and schema validation where supported.
- Manual entry, canonical explanations, and deterministic screening must work when Groq is disabled, unavailable, rate-limited, or returns invalid output.

## Frontend quality bar

The UI should feel like a modern, attractive clinical-research workspace: clear hierarchy, compact information density, and trustworthy evidence presentation with a distinct visual identity. “Minimal” means intentional and uncluttered—not plain, unfinished, or visually sterile. It must not look like a generic AI dashboard.

### Visual direction

- Establish a deliberate visual identity: a neutral base, confident dark text, subtle tinted surfaces, and one memorable brand accent. A restrained two-color gradient is acceptable in a hero, login panel, or key empty state when it supports the hierarchy.
- Use semantic status colors only for `pass`, `fail`, and `unknown`; never use status color as general decoration.
- Use a high-quality modern sans font with a system fallback, plus tabular numerals for scores, dates, and result matrices. Typography should carry much of the visual character.
- Define tokens once for color, spacing, typography, radius, shadow, duration, and easing. Reuse them instead of inventing per-component values.
- Use consistent radii (roughly 6–12px), thin borders, tasteful soft shadows where elevation is meaningful, and a clear 4/8px spacing rhythm.
- Favor tables, structured rows, and split panes for clinical facts and criterion evidence. Cards should group meaningful regions, not wrap every field.
- Use a responsive grid that collapses cleanly on narrower laptop/tablet widths. Never rely on a fixed desktop-only canvas.

### Interaction and animation

- Motion must make state changes clearer and more polished: button press, drawer/modal entry, row expansion, route entry, optimistic save, result filtering, and subtle staggered content entry.
- Animate primarily `opacity` and `transform` for normal UI transitions; target roughly 160–260ms with a clean ease-out curve. A subtle skeleton shimmer is acceptable while data is genuinely loading.
- Do not animate layout continuously, use parallax, autoplay decorative motion, bouncing icons, typewriter text, or loading spinners that never resolve.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and provide instant equivalents.
- Buttons must have hover, focus-visible, active, disabled, and loading states. Keyboard navigation must remain obvious.
- Display skeletons or concise loading states for data fetches. An API failure must look like an error, never like a successful empty state.

### Explicitly avoid

- Unrestrained rainbow gradients, neon glows, floating blobs, noisy mesh backgrounds, decorative particles, or glass effects that reduce readability.
- Oversized landing-page heroes, giant headings, excessive whitespace, stock photos, or AI-generated medical imagery.
- A grid of identical metric cards with no actionable information.
- Excessive rounded pills, badges, icons, shadows, or emoji.
- Generic claims such as “AI-powered insights” without showing the criterion evidence that supports the result.
- Hiding pass/fail/unknown logic inside a long generated paragraph.
- A sterile page made only of default browser controls and plain boxes. Important entry points, empty states, navigation, and result summaries should feel designed and memorable.

### Required visual review

For any material frontend change:

1. Run the frontend production build and relevant UI tests.
2. Inspect the changed route at desktop and narrow widths using browser/screenshot tooling when available.
3. Check empty, loading, error, populated, long-text, and `unknown` states.
4. Verify contrast, keyboard focus, and reduced-motion behavior.
5. Report the visual states inspected in the handoff.

## Suggested implementation choices

- React + TypeScript + Vite for the web app.
- Keep styling to one coherent approach chosen in Phase 1/5 (CSS variables plus CSS modules or a carefully configured utility system). Do not mix multiple design systems.
- Use accessible primitives for complex controls such as dialogs, menus, comboboxes, and tooltips; keep ordinary layout/components lightweight.
- Use a restrained icon set only where it improves recognition. Icons always need labels or accessible names.
- Use browser end-to-end testing for the final visual workflow; this is more valuable than adding a design-heavy component library.
