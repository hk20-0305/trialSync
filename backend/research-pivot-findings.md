# TrialSync Research Pivot: Feasibility Findings and Recommended Scope

**Date:** 2026-07-19
**Status:** Feasibility findings; implementation scope selected on 2026-07-26 and dropout-data
strategy clarified on 2026-08-01
**Relationship to existing project:** Incremental extension of the completed TrialSync application; not a replacement or total rewrite.

This document preserves the feasibility evidence behind the pivot. The locked scope, phase order, dataset sizes, and exit criteria live in
[`research-extension-implementation-plan.md`](research-extension-implementation-plan.md). The concise decision rationale lives in
[`research-feasibility-rating-and-local-llm.md`](research-feasibility-rating-and-local-llm.md).

## Executive conclusion

The proposed pivot is valuable, but it should be presented as a research extension to TrialSync rather than as four independent production features.

The strongest incremental direction is:

1. Add measured LangChain retrieval over approved trial eligibility criteria and a
   schema-validated Gemini eligibility-summary generator.
2. Reuse the existing deterministic, evidence-backed screening engine.
3. Add reproducible synthetic dropout-risk experiments with logistic regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, SHAP, and MLflow.
4. Add research-only cohort embeddings, DBSCAN clustering, and FAISS patient similarity.
5. Add canonical PDF reporting, a separate research UI/API, GitHub Actions CI, and final evaluation;
   keep automated CD as a future operational option.

BioBERT is deferred from the selected implementation scope. It remains a possible future experiment only after one supervised task and a suitable labelled dataset are approved.

The current eligibility decision must remain deterministic. Machine-learning models, FAISS similarity, SHAP explanations, and LLM/RAG output may assist discovery or explain a result, but they must not silently approve evidence or change `pass`, `fail`, `unknown`, or the final screening state.

## Proposed research project

### Recommended title

> **TrialSync: Clinical Trial Patient Matching and Dropout Prediction**

If access to a valid participant-level dropout dataset is secured:

> **TrialSync Research: Explainable Trial Matching, Cohort Discovery, and Participant Retention-Risk Modeling**

### Safer product claim

Use “research-grade full-stack prototype” or “deployable academic platform” rather than “production clinical platform.” MIMIC-III is restricted credentialed data, and none of the proposed predictive models should be described as clinically validated or suitable for autonomous enrollment decisions.

## Dataset feasibility

### MIMIC-III

MIMIC-III contains deidentified ICU data for more than 40,000 patients, including diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory values, vital signs, and clinical notes. It is not a clinical-trial participant registry and does not provide trial enrollment or dropout outcomes.

Access requires PhysioNet credentialing, human-subjects/HIPAA training, and a data-use agreement. The raw database and restricted clinical notes must not be committed to Git, bundled into the public demo, or sent to hosted LLM APIs without explicit authorization.

### Trial eligibility-criteria corpus

The RAG requirement does not need a public trial-registry integration. TrialSync already owns the
right retrieval unit: immutable approved trial versions with ordered inclusion and exclusion
criteria. These records form a versioned, checksummed corpus that can be expanded with synthetic
trial fixtures for retrieval training, evaluation, and demonstration.

One indexed chunk should represent one approved criterion with its criterion ID, trial-version ID,
kind, source text, order, and content checksum. LangChain ranks candidate trials from those
chunks; each bounded candidate then expands to its complete approved criteria set before Gemini
generates the structured summary.

### Candidate participant-level retention datasets

The NCI NCTN/NCORP Data Archive documents a candidate schema for a bounded retention-risk research experiment: **NCT02054715-D1**, a randomized multimedia-versus-print psychoeducation study for patients with cancer who were eligible for clinical trials. Its public data dictionary includes a participant identifier, baseline demographics, cancer type, recent treatment history, education, income, marital status, study group, `Dropouttime` (`0=no dropout`, `1=dropout at follow-up 1`, `2=dropout at follow-up 2`), and a `Dropout` reason field. This verifies that the study recorded a genuine participant-level dropout outcome, but the public dictionary does not contain the participant rows.

It can support a narrowly framed prototype such as “research-only retention-risk prediction in
the NCT02054715-D1 study.” It cannot support a claim that the model predicts dropout across cancer
trials or clinical trials generally: it is one study with one intervention context, and its event
count and follow-up structure must be inspected after access is granted. It also does not provide
the multi-condition visit, dose, laboratory, and adverse-event stream required by TrialSync's
day-30/day-90 missed-dose Scenario Lab.

NCI now directs researchers to obtain NCTN/NCORP patient-level data through dbGaP, but
NCT02054715 is not in NCI's current available-dataset list as of 2026-08-01. The public material is
therefore sufficient for schema design and NCT-inspired synthetic fixtures, not real-data model
training or evaluation. If rows later become available, use them under the applicable source terms
and do not send them to a hosted model provider unless those terms permit it.

If participant rows become legitimately accessible, use NCT02054715-D1 as a separate external benchmark with its own task,
feature schema, split, artifacts, and claim label. Do not merge it into the public synthetic cohort
or generate look-alike rows and count them as additional independent real participants. Any
NCT-derived synthetic data remains a potentially governed derivative until the applicable terms
and disclosure review say otherwise.

For future multi-study work, [Project Data Sphere](https://data.projectdatasphere.org/) provides de-identified patient-level randomized cancer-trial datasets. A dataset is suitable only after its study documentation confirms a usable completion/discontinuation outcome and baseline or pre-horizon predictors. When data are in CDISC SDTM form, inspect the Disposition (`DS`) domain: its standard fields record completion/discontinuation status, date, and primary reason. Do not assume every Project Data Sphere study includes a usable `DS` domain or compatible follow-up window. [CDISC disposition guidance](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/cdash/cdashig-v2-0)

### Central label problem

The proposed datasets do not support patient-level clinical-trial dropout prediction by themselves:

- MIMIC patients are ICU patients, not identified clinical-trial participants.
- Trial registry records describe studies, not individual enrolled participants.
- Discharge, mortality, readmission, or disappearance from MIMIC cannot be treated as trial dropout.
- A proxy label created from missing later records would be clinically and methodologically invalid.

Therefore, “predict patient trial dropout” remains blocked for the originally listed public datasets. NCT02054715-D1 is a viable future study-specific adapter, but not a currently available row-level benchmark. Any selected dataset must include enrollment, follow-up, withdrawal/dropout, reason, and censoring information sufficient for the chosen prediction task.

## Feature-by-feature assessment

| Feature | Feasibility | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| Patient dropout prediction | Feasible as a reproducible synthetic fixed-horizon experiment; NCT02054715-D1 publicly documents a genuine but study-specific outcome schema, not participant rows | Implement the public hybrid synthetic protocol; if rows become legitimately accessible, run NCT02054715-D1 as a separate external benchmark rather than merging or amplifying it |
| XGBoost/LightGBM | Feasible when labels exist | Use time-aware feature windows, leakage controls, calibration, and model-versioned inference |
| SHAP explanations | Feasible | Explain predictive risk features only; do not call SHAP an eligibility score |
| DBSCAN cohort discovery | Feasible research module | Build versioned patient-fact and screening-profile vectors from synthetic screening data and report stability and interpretable summaries |
| FAISS similarity search | Feasible | Index the same approved cohort representations and label neighbors as research similarity, not evidence |
| BioBERT ICD extraction | Feasible after task definition | Deferred from the selected implementation scope |
| BioBERT eligibility matcher | Requires new labels | Deferred; do not train an opaque replacement for the deterministic engine |
| RAG over trial criteria | Strong fit | Implement and evaluate retrieval separately, then supply versioned retrieved context to a bounded citation-validated generator |
| Gemini eligibility summary | Strong fit | Generate a schema-validated summary from only the patient context and criteria returned by LangChain |
| LangChain | Required by brief | Use it as the explicit retrieval orchestration layer over versioned approved criteria |
| Docker and GitHub Actions | Feasible | Run CI now; deploy manually with migrations and health checks, adding protected CD only if needed |
| PDF eligibility report | Strong fit | Generate from stored canonical screening JSON; LLM prose is supplementary |

## A. Dropout or retention-risk prediction

### What is scientifically required

For the selected synthetic longitudinal experiment, define and freeze:

- an index date;
- a prediction horizon, such as dropout within 30 or 90 days;
- the exact dropout event and reason taxonomy;
- censoring and competing events;
- a feature cutoff so post-outcome information cannot leak into training;
- patient-level and temporal train/validation/test splits.

The approved benchmark is a fixed-horizon binary task: use features available by day 30 to predict dropout by day 90. Survival modeling and controlled real-world validation are later research options, not implementation dependencies.

### Recommended model experiments

- Logistic regression as an interpretable baseline.
- XGBoost and LightGBM as tree-based baselines.
- Aggregated event-window features rather than pretending tree models consume raw sequences.
- AUROC, AUPRC, calibration, sensitivity, specificity, and subgroup performance.
- SHAP feature contributions for model explanation.
- MLflow runs containing dataset version, feature schema, code version, model parameters, metrics, and artifacts.

### API boundary

Add a separate research prediction response, for example:

```json
{
  "risk_type": "retention_risk",
  "risk_probability": 0.64,
  "horizon_days": 90,
  "model_name": "retention-risk-lightgbm",
  "model_version": "7",
  "model_alias": "champion",
  "explanations": [
    {"feature": "missed_followup_count_30d", "contribution": 0.21}
  ],
  "clinical_disclaimer": "Research prediction; not a clinical decision."
}
```

This endpoint must not mutate the screening result or convert a risk probability into eligibility.

MLflow currently recommends model aliases and tags for references such as `champion` and `challenger`. [MLflow Model Registry workflows](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/ml/model-registry/workflow/)

## B. Cohort clustering and patient similarity

This is a feasible and visually compelling research extension built from synthetic screening data, not from the dropout-training table.

### Suggested pipeline

```text
unique synthetic patient snapshots + fixed approved trial panel
  -> exact existing deterministic screening engine
  -> versioned patient-fact and screening-profile vectors
  -> separate DBSCAN cluster runs
  -> separate exact FAISS indexes
  -> Cohort Atlas and similar-patient views
```

### Required safeguards

- Count each patient once in the cohort; a patient × trial result matrix is a feature representation, not extra patients.
- Encode `unknown` explicitly rather than treating it as pass, fail, or zero evidence.
- Freeze patient generator, trial versions, screening-engine version, feature schema, and random seed.
- Version the feature pipeline, embedding model, and FAISS index.
- Report cluster stability, noise points, and clinically interpretable summaries without asserting discovered phenotypes.
- Keep similarity separate from eligibility evidence.
- Exclude dropout outcomes, risk scores, chat text, and RAG output from cohort features.

FAISS supports exact and approximate dense-vector similarity search, including cosine similarity through normalized inner products. [FAISS repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)

For the initial scale, an exact CPU index is sufficient. A vector database or separate microservice is not required.

## C. Deferred BioBERT experiment

**Scope decision:** Deferred on 2026-07-26 and not part of the approved extension implementation.

“ICD extraction” and “eligibility criterion matching” are different supervised tasks and should not be presented as one model objective.

MIMIC ICD codes can provide weak labels for document-level coding, but they do not provide span-level annotations or clinical-trial eligibility labels. Eligibility matching therefore needs a separately annotated dataset or a reviewed synthetic benchmark.

BioBERT was evaluated for biomedical NER, relation extraction, and question answering; its pretraining does not guarantee performance on this project’s clinical eligibility task. [BioBERT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08746)

Reconsider it only after choosing one labelled task, securing a valid dataset, and defining a leakage-safe held-out evaluation. Any future output must remain reviewable and disconnected from final eligibility.

## D. LangChain/Gemini RAG and eligibility reports

This is the most natural extension of the existing TrialSync product.

### Recommended flow

```text
Coordinator uploads or selects a patient record
  -> review/approve extracted patient facts
  -> LangChain ranks candidate trials from approved criteria
  -> expand each bounded candidate to its complete approved criteria set
  -> Gemini generates a structured, criterion-cited eligibility summary
  -> coordinator selects a candidate trial
  -> existing deterministic screening
  -> canonical evidence-backed result
  -> PDF report generated from stored result
```

RAG should retrieve and rank candidates. It must not replace deterministic criterion evaluation.

The report generator should use the stored screening JSON as its source of truth. LLM-generated wording may supplement the canonical explanation, but it must not invent facts, citations, or outcome changes.

The existing screening explanation assistant may remain Groq-backed. It is a different feature
from the Gemini RAG summary and should keep its existing grounding rules:

- only one authorized screening per conversation;
- latest ten messages maximum;
- citations validated against stored evaluations;
- no database, web, MCP, code-execution, or write tools;
- refusal of diagnosis, treatment, enrollment advice, unrelated questions, and prompt injection;
- canonical fallback when the provider is disabled or fails.

Provider resilience must bound Gemini context/output, maintain a short in-process cooldown, limit
concurrency, retry only within a small budget, and cache only owner-scoped results keyed by patient
snapshot, corpus/index, retriever, model, and prompt versions. LangChain retrieval remains
available when Gemini generation fails.

## Recommended incremental architecture

Keep the existing modules for authentication, patients, snapshots, trial versions, criteria, deterministic screening, evidence, history, and bounded explanation chat.

Add separate research-oriented modules:

```text
research/
  eligibility_rag/       # LangChain criteria retrieval and Gemini structured summaries
  dropout_data/           # synthetic longitudinal enrollment-event protocol
  risk_models/            # training, inference, SHAP, scenario analysis
  cohort_profiles/        # screening-derived vectors, DBSCAN, FAISS
  mlflow_tracking/        # runs, artifacts, model aliases
  provider_resilience/    # cooldown, retry, concurrency, and safe caches
```

Suggested data entities:

- `eligibility_rag_indexes`: corpus checksum, chunking/retriever/index versions, build timestamp.
- `eligibility_rag_results`: patient snapshot, candidate trial, criterion citations, rank,
  retrieval score, Gemini model/prompt version.
- `research_enrollment_links`: immutable linkage among a generated enrollment, patient snapshot,
  approved trial version, and canonical potentially eligible screening.
- `research_model_versions`: MLflow name, version, alias, feature schema, validation status.
- `research_predictions`: subject, model version, prediction horizon, output, explanation metadata.
- `cohort_runs`: feature pipeline version, embedding version, cluster parameters, metrics.
- `similarity_queries`: query embedding/index version and returned research neighbors.

Research outputs should be visibly labeled as research analytics and should not be conflated with screening evidence.

## Selected implementation sequence

The phase order is intentionally maintained only in
[`research-extension-implementation-plan.md`](research-extension-implementation-plan.md) so findings cannot drift into a second competing plan. In summary: canonical PDF reporting and GitHub Actions CI come first, followed by the synthetic longitudinal dropout protocol, MLflow-tracked models, screening-derived cohorts and similarity, LangChain/Gemini eligibility RAG, and final hardening/evaluation. Automated CD remains deferred.

## Claims to avoid

- “Automatically enrolls or rejects patients.”
- “Predicts clinical-trial dropout” when the dataset contains no trial dropout labels, or when evidence comes from a single study but the claim implies generalization.
- “Production-ready clinical AI.”
- “SHAP-based eligibility scoring.”
- “BioBERT matches eligibility criteria” without a labeled held-out matching dataset.
- “MIMIC data is public” without mentioning credentialed access and the data-use agreement.
- “The LLM verified eligibility.”

## Final recommendation

Proceed with the selected scope: **LangChain candidate retrieval + complete approved-criteria
expansion + Gemini structured eligibility summaries + deterministic screening + grounded
reporting** as the product centerpiece, with **linked hybrid synthetic dropout modeling, MLflow, SHAP,
trial-grouped retention views, DBSCAN cohorts, and FAISS similarity** as the research analytics
layer. GitHub Actions provides CI; manual Compose deployment remains the configured delivery path
until automated CD is needed. BioBERT is deferred.
NCT02054715-D1 work is a separate optional future external benchmark and is not a runtime, build,
test, public-demo, or clean-reproduction dependency. It becomes active only if participant rows
become legitimately accessible and a study-specific protocol is recorded.

This approach adds meaningful research depth while preserving the architecture, tests, safety boundaries, and user experience already built in TrialSync.
