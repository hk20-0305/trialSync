        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>Use the seeded workspace to walk through the complete evidence-backed flow.</p>
        <ol className="help-steps">
          <li><strong>Review records.</strong> Open a synthetic patient and inspect structured facts, choose details from the searchable catalog, or use the review-first import flow.</li>
          <li><strong>Edit safely.</strong> Removing a detail requires a reason, keeps an activity entry, and offers a short Undo action. Existing screenings keep their immutable snapshots; only future screenings use restored or changed active details.</li>
          <li><strong>Save a trial.</strong> Create or import a trial, review its criteria, then save the protocol.</li>
          <li><strong>Run screening.</strong> Compare one patient snapshot with one saved trial protocol, or run a bounded synchronous batch.</li>
          <li><strong>Explain the result.</strong> Open a saved screening to inspect each criterion, evidence source, missing information, and the grounded assistant.</li>

        <h2>Result assistant</h2>
        <p>The assistant answers questions about one stored screening only. It cites the criterion and evidence identifiers supplied by the server and cannot change the result.</p>
        <ul className="help-list">
          <li>Suggestions are finite, evenly arranged, deduplicated, and limited to the selected screening.</li>
          <li>Enter sends a question; Shift+Enter adds a new line.</li>
          <li>The transcript scrolls internally, shows a typing state while an answer is generated, and returns focus to the composer afterward.</li>
          <li>Citation links focus the referenced criterion and provide a route back to the assistant.</li>
          <li>Timeout, rate-limit, invalid-response, and provider failures preserve the question for an explicit retry. Ambiguous network failures require reloading history first to prevent duplicates.</li>
          <li>Advice, diagnosis, enrollment requests, unrelated health questions, prompt injection, and unsupported claims are refused safely.</li>

        <h2>Data and provider boundaries</h2>
        <p>Groq may propose reviewable import candidates or explain stored evidence. It cannot approve candidates, create evidence, access another record, or set a screening state. Manual entry, canonical explanations, and deterministic screening continue to work when Groq is disabled or unavailable.</p>
        <ul className="help-list">
          <li>Only synthetic data belongs in this educational workspace.</li>
          <li>Imported patient concepts are checked against the active catalog. Unknown, incomplete, or incompatible candidates are shown as review warnings and remain review-only instead of becoming screening evidence.</li>
          <li>Conversation memory is scoped to one screening and bounded to the latest ten messages.</li>
          <li>Operational chat metrics are privacy-safe logs containing provider/model, prompt version, latency, validation outcome, answer state, and citation count—not questions, documents, or raw provider payloads.</li>
          <li>Responses are intentionally non-streaming; the interface shows a bounded typing state while validation completes.</li>

        <h2>Verification and limitations</h2>
        <p>The current local gate covers 90 backend tests, 37 frontend tests, six browser workflows, lint, type checking, migrations, the production build, and the held-out synthetic evaluation. These are software checks, not clinical validation or trained-model performance claims.</p>
        <p className="help-note">The rule DSL supports a bounded subset of eligibility language. OCR is local and best-effort. Batch screening is synchronous and bounded. See the repository documentation for the full architecture, evaluation, and limitations record.</p>
